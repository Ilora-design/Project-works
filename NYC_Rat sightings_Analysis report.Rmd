# Executive Summary

**Unveiling the Rat Epidemic in New York City**

```{r image}

```

*Changes made to one of the original graphic (pie chart for Rat sightings across NYC)*

The rat sightings in every borough faceted by year presentation in pie charts was misleading as this does not have clarity in conveying the yearly trend. Pie charts are not effective in representing trend on time series. Also, it is difficult to visualize the difference in values in a pie chart briefly. For showing trend over year, line chart is the most appropriate and that has been used. Also, for each borough a separate line chart has been plotted that also shows how the incidents varied over year in each borough. 


*The story with new graphic: Unveiling the Rat Epidemic in New York City*

Rats are pervasive in the urban ecology and are carriers of infectious pathogens. Among cities in the United States, New York city hosts one of the most extensive rat populations. This is of great concern for public health. Between the years 2010 and 2017, New York city has experienced a significant surge in rat sightings. The years 2013 to 2016 has witnessed a significant spike in rat sightings due to sociodemographic and physical landscape. Rats are highly prevalent near subway lines and public spaces [1]. Brooklyn and Manhattan have the highest number of subways [2]. This reflects in our analysis where we see Brooklyn is the borough with the highest incidents of rat sightings followed by Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. Moreover, the months May, June, July and August have the highest incidences and November and December have the lowest incidences of rat sightings as observed in our analysis. The possible reason is the breeding season during warm season (like late summers and early fall) and also rats aggressively find food to stockpile for the winters [3]. We see in our analysis that weekends have lower number of reported rat sightings than weekends, as weekends have lower garbage and food disposal than weekdays, when businesses are operational [4]. Hence, the analysis performed gives an insight on the rat epidemic in New York city.  


*The principles of CRAP*

The principles of CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) have been meticulously applied while designing the visualizations for rat sightings in NYC. This has been done to ensure effective presentation of data, by using distinctive colours and contrast and different font to identify data and the underlying insights from each borough in New York City. Same colour scheme for every borough has been used to ensure repetition. Like, in the line chart incidents over time, all the boroughs have been represented in different shades of brown. In fact, in the other charts wherever boroughs have been represented, the same colour combination have been used. The charts have been clearly aligned and organized and elements have been positioned for a clear logical flow of the eyes. Proximity has been employed for grouping of related elements together and strategic placement and visual cues were used to indicate the relatable data points and annotations and facilitating a clear, intuitive, and easy understanding of complex data relationships. The CRAP design principles have been appropriately used to enhance the report and make it easily and effectively comprehensible for the reader. 


**Kieran Healy’s principles of great visualizations:**

Kieran Healy’s principles of effective visualization were applied to analyse rat sightings in New York city. It was ensured that the visualizations were clear, comprehensible, and relevant. In the first two graphs, line graph has been chosen to represent trend of incidents of rat sightings over time. This is aligned with the selection of an appropriate graph for time series. This graph helped to understand trend over the boroughs. 
Distinct shades of brown have been used to represent each borough. All visualizations have been kept in shades of brown as brown has a natural association with dirt, grime and decay which is strongly associated with rat infestation. Also, dark shades of brown show a good contrast with light shades, like shown in the graphs, with higher incidents of rat sightings darker shades of brown have been used and lighter shades for lower values of the same.  This helped to prevent confusion and enhance intuitive comparison.
According to Healy’s principles, the visualization process aimed to have a balance between complexity and simplicity. This helped to convey deep insights in a simple way for audiences, even without specialized knowledge to interpret the data. The equilibrium was maintained to inform and engage the audiences on the rat sightings in the city.
