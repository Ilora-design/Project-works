    "# Introduction\n",
    "This user - friendly code can help Retiree family in Massachusetts (MA) or California (CA) to plan for the future.\n",
    "The code considers Federal tax and state tax, interest from savings and IRA account and, expenses to forecast how long the savings might last.\n",
    "Being straightforward and easy to understand, this code can be easily used by anybody.\n",
    "The code has three sections:\n",
    "* Section 1: Gives the expenses forecast\n",
    "* Section 2: Gives retiree income projection for residents of MA\n",
    "* Section 3: Gives retiree income projection for residents of CA\n",
